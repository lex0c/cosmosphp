# How to Contribute
=====================

## Pull Requests

1. Make fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, component or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each component branch to the "developing" branch

> It is very important to separate new component or improvements into separate components branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

Each new branch must be created from the 'master' branch and, if necessary pull or merge the branches necessary to develop the component.

##### OBS: Each component or improvement must be accompanied by its respective documentation of use. Besides clear of PHPDoc in code. Thank you!

###### *Follow that git flow [developing, features, bugfixes, component1, component2, etc...]
